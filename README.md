# Fair Dating Platform Manifesto

* In such a platform, everyone must have equal opportunities.
* The platform should provide tools that makes it easy to find people who meet users' criteria like advanced search mechanisms such as granular filters and full profile text search.
* The platform should be a safe place for absolutely everyone by means of active moderation.
* The platform should empower users by providing guidance and tips to improve their dating skills.
* Corollary the platform should provide users with feedback, analytics, and insights about their dating journey.
* The platform should have a feedback loop mechanism built in for active users.
* All features in the platform should be aligned with the primary goal of finding for each user their significant other, any other feature is considered anti-feature.

I know this manifesto is user centric and making a profitable system from it is not the easiest goal but not all useful platforms in the world are for the sake of profit like Wikipedia ;)
